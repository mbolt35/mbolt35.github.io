My name is Matt Bolt, and I live in Greenville, SC with my wife and 3 kids. I've been writing code since I was 11 years old, and have been programming professionally since 2008. I love playing games in my spare time, notable favorites include:
* Dark Souls
* Halo
* Destiny
* The Last of Us
* Borderlands
* Zelda

I have a deep passion for music, and grew up playing any instrument I could get my hands on. My current favorite is my Taylor acoustic guitar, but I've recently picked up a Gibson Chet Atkins SST that sounds incredible.

Overall, I'd say I care a lot about my craft, and while this blog is meant to ultimately push me to write more, I hope it can help others along the way. 

Thanks for taking the time to allow me to share.

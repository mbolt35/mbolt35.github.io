### Life

Based on the date of my last blog post, it’s been quite a while since I’ve shared anything here. Oh, but how the times are changing, and while this space has remained quiet, I can assure you that my life has been the complete opposite. During the “blog blackout,” I became a father of _three_, built a new house, lost my two best friends (my doggos Cooper and Annie), and lost my job due to downsizing. The perfect emotional curvature of love, possession, heartbreak, and loss, right? The good news is that I am here, I made it; the storm has mostly subsided and while the emotional swings of life can be debilitating, I feel refreshed and free from the proverbial shackles of the “daily grind” (at least for now).

### Enklu

Like the 90s classic “Closing Time” by Semisonic says:
> “Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.” 

While this may just be incoherent ramblings meant to be passed off as wisdom, I choose to believe Semisonic knew what they were talking about. Back in May, I accepted the role of _Principal Software Engineer_ at [Enklu](http://www.enklu.com), a company that is changing the world with AR. I’m working daily with some of the most talented people I’ve come across in 13 years of writing software, and I’m ecstatic to see what we can do.

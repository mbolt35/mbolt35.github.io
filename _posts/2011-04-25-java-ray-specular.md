Just committed a fairly large update which you can see/read here:
[https://github.com/mbolt35/javaray/commit/03ad54784c54975216b93174e19db7ee26fd9c0b](https://github.com/mbolt35/javaray/commit/03ad54784c54975216b93174e19db7ee26fd9c0b)

I did manage to fix the issue where reflections were showing up on all sides of a scene object:

Next, I'm going to be working on some new types of objects, lights, and externally loaded scenes.
